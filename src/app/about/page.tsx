          <h3>Head of Process Automation &amp; Developer</h3>
          <p>
            As an applied computer science graduate from TU Chemnitz, I am
            pushing the boundaries of technology and innovation. My journey has
            taken me from cutting-edge research to leading the process
            automation team at STTech.
          </p>
          <p>
            I expanded my horizons with a transformative semester at San Jos√©
            State University, USA, and a course at Stanford University,
            absorbing diverse perspectives in tech. <br />
            During my master thesis, I architected real-time optimization
            algorithms in C++ to make trains more energy-efficient. This sparked
            the interest of a professor from TU Munich, who recruited me to
            STTech. Over three years as a developer and 1.5 years as the head of
            the Process Automation department, I&apos;ve improved my skills and
            lead teams towards impressiv products.
