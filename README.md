While this website doesn't inherently require the use of Next.js and
React, I've chosen to showcase my development skills by building the
entire site with Next.js. Despite the minimal interaction with content and
the absence of server functionality, this choice reflects my commitment
for creating cutting-edge technologies in my projects.
